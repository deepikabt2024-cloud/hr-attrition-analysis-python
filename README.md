# hr-attrition-analysis-python

This project analyzes employee attrition to identify key factors influencing turnover. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), the analysis explores demographic, financial, and work-related patterns that contribute to employees leaving the company.
The dataset contains 1470 employees, of which 237 employees resigned, resulting in an overall attrition rate of 16.1%.

Key Insights

✔ Overall Attrition: 16.1%
✔ Gender: Male attrition (150) > Female attrition (87)
✔ Department: R&D has the highest attrition
✔ Marital Status: Single employees leave most frequently
✔ Salary: Lower-income employees show highest attrition
✔ Average Tenure:

Males who left → 4.69 years

Females who left → 5.92 years
✔ Salary Hike %: Most attrition cases came from employees receiving 11–14% hikes

These findings suggest attrition is influenced by a mix of income, early-career tenure, marital status, and department pressures—especially in R&D.
